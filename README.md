# Hello-World

//* I have not coded for over 20 years when I finished undergraduate degree in computer science. Back then it was the late 90's and everything was C++ and Java. JavaScript was just a baby. Object Oriented Programming was all the rage and Microsoft had just developed C# to compete with Java wihtin the .NET world. *//

// I hope to learn the basics of Full Stack development and oversee the creation of some very cool apps!
